# Functional-Transfer-Neural-Networks

Author: Cheng-Hao Cai

These codes are developed to support the paper about functional transfer neural networks. The preprint of the paper can be downloaded from https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10403

The codes are developed based on the Machine Learning Practical Platform developed by Pawel Swietojanski, the University of Edinburgh.

The Machine Learning Practical Platform can be downloaded from https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical

Before using the codes in this repository, please make sure that you have downloaded the platform and known how to use it. Then you could use the codes in the platform.
